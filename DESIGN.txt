Update 6: OOPVDOD, the game Design document. New direction.
Game was canned.
We know you haven't worked on the project for some months, but we're sure you coded it clean enough to be able to make some minor changes.
New publisher is interested, but has a few ideas. These shouldn't take you more than a week.

0. strip out the javascript stuff, we might want to release on uFruit devices.
1. The player is in control of a character in the world.
1.1 they have starting gold and other things, need to be able to specify.
2. The world is continuous.
2.1. There is a farm that you start in, need to be able to specify how big.
2.2. There is a path to the woods guarded by bears
2.2.1 The woods is a random encounter area.
2.3. There is a path to the shop
2.3.1 the shop sells seeds.
2.4. There is a locked path to the cliffs
2.4.1 where rare herbs can be picked.
2.5 There are no gaps in the world tiles.
2.5.1 The edge needs filling in too.
3. The earth can be ploughed. (holding space digs)
3.1 ploughing isn't instant, it takes time, have to hold space until ploughed.
3.2 the player can let go early to move, and not have to wait until stopped to start the plough.
4. The ploughed earth can have seeds/cuttings planted in it.
4.1 you start with 4 owl seeds, you can get more from the shop.
4.2 number and type of seeds/cuttings must be shown on screen. Use an icon.
4.3 you can harvest fully grown plants, or fully grown and fruiting plants.
4.3.1 harvest owls to get owls
4.3.2 harvest chests to get gold.
4.3.2.1 They don't go away, but take time to fruit again...
4.3.3 harvest locked doors to get keys.
4.3.3.1 They also don't go away. Never fruit again?
4.4 harvesting owls has a 100% change of unploughing the field.
4.4.1 Unless the player has bought the improved spade (then specified amount).
5. The plants grow over time (specified).
5.1 Once fully grown, you can cut them down.
5.1.1 must take a few seconds, and animate them growing.
5.1.2 some seeds take ages to grow (config)
5.2 some plants grow fruit.
5.2.1 If they do, they only give fruit after they are fully grown.
5.2.2 Initially half the normal fruit griwing time.
5.3 the plants should always blow gently in the wind. Unless they are trees.
5.4 Owls, Money, Doors, Broadleaf, Raspberry, Peach tree, Arrowroot, make it so we can add new ones from script.
6. If you get to the chest at the end of the path to the woods, you get some gold.
6.1 Which is cool. You should show this on screen. Animate the coins going into your gold counter.
6.2 you can spend it in the shop, you can afford chest plant seeds, but not the spade or more owl seeds.
6.3 We need to be able to add new stuff to the shop.
7. That's it, the whole game.
8. use a scripting language that's allowed on uFruit fones, like lua.
