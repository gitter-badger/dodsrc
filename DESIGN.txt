Update 3: OOPVDOD, the game Design document. Tweaks before launch.

1. The player is in control of a character in the world.
1.1. They move from square to square by pressing the wasd / arrow keys.
1.2. Movement is a whole square at once (the dude animates from one space to another.)
1.3. The dude needs to turn to face where he is going.
1.4. Movement is a confined to the 16 farm tiles.
2. The world is a farm, 4 x 4 plots of earth.
3. The earth can be ploughed. (holding space digs)
3.1 ploughing isn't instant, it takes time, have to hold space until ploughed.
3.2 the player can let go early to move.
4. The ploughed earth can have owls planted in it.
4.1 only while they have enough seeds. you start with 5
4.2 number of seeds must be shown on screen.
4.3 you can harvest fully grown owls to get more owl seeds.
4.4 harvesting only has a 50% change of unploughing the field.
5. The owls grow over time. Once fully grown, you can cut them down.
5.1 must take a few seconds, and animate them growing.
5.2 should always blow gently in the wind.
6. That's it, the whole game.
