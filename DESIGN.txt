Update 1: OOPVDOD, the game Design document. Final version.

1. The player is in control of a character in the world.
1.1. They move from square to square by pressing the wasd / arrow keys.
1.1. Movement is a whole square at once (the dude animates from one space to another.)
2. The world is a farm, 3 x 3 plots of earth.
3. The earth can be ploughed. (pressing space does this)
4. The ploughed earth can have owls planted in it.
4.1 only while they have enough seeds. you start with 5
4.2 you can harvest fully grown owls to get more owl seeds.
5. The owls grow over time. Once fully grown, you can cut them down.
6. That's it, the whole game.

Woo, a game design document. I bet this never changes througout the whole game development.
